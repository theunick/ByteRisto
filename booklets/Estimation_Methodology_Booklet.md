## 1. METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Function Points Analysis

Function Points (FP) is a software sizing method that quantifies functionality from the user's perspective. It measures five primary components:

1. **External Inputs (EI)**: Data or control information processed from outside the application
2. **External Outputs (EO)**: Data or control information sent outside the application
3. **External Inquiries (EQ)**: Interactive inputs requiring immediate responses
4. **Internal Logical Files (ILF)**: Groups of logically related data maintained by the application
5. **External Interface Files (EIF)**: Groups of logically related data referenced by the application but maintained by another

### 1.2 COCOMO II Model

COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model) is an algorithmic software cost estimation model that estimates effort, schedule, and team size. It uses three sub-models:
- **Application Composition Model**: For prototyping efforts
- **Early Design Model**: For initial architecture and requirements
- **Post-Architecture Model**: For detailed design and implementation

For ByteRisto, we used the Post-Architecture model as we have detailed requirements and architecture.

## 2. FUNCTION POINTS ANALYSIS DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 2.1 External Inputs (EI) Analysis

**Methodology**: Identified all unique user inputs that cross the application boundary and trigger processing.

| Function | Complexity Rationale | Weight Assignment |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Menu Item Creation | Average - Multiple data fields, validation required | 4 FP |
| Order Creation | Average - Complex validation, multiple entities | 4 FP |
| Payment Processing | Complex - Multiple payment types, validation, external interfaces | 6 FP per type |

**Total EI**: 12 functions = 55 Function Points

### 2.2 External Outputs (EO) Analysis

**Methodology**: Identified all unique outputs that cross the application boundary with derived data.

| Function | Complexity Rationale | Weight Assignment |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Menu Display | Average - Formatted output with filtering | 5 FP per category |
| Management Reports | Complex - Calculated metrics, multiple data sources | 7 FP |

**Total EO**: 11 functions = 59 Function Points

### 2.3 External Inquiries (EQ) Analysis

**Methodology**: Identified input-output combinations that retrieve data without significant processing.

| Function | Complexity Rationale | Weight Assignment |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Menu Item Search | Simple - Direct data retrieval | 3 FP |
| Order Status Check | Simple - Status lookup | 3 FP |
| Item Detail View | Average - Multiple data elements | 4 FP |

**Total EQ**: 6 functions = 21 Function Points

### 2.4 Internal Logical Files (ILF) Analysis

**Methodology**: Identified all major data groups maintained by the application.

| File | Complexity Rationale | Weight Assignment |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Menu Items | Average - 15-20 data elements, 2-5 record types | 10 FP |
| Orders | Complex - >20 data elements, >5 record types, complex relationships | 15 FP |
| Users/Roles | Simple - <15 data elements, 1-2 record types | 7 FP |

**Total ILF**: 5 files = 49 Function Points

### 2.5 External Interface Files (EIF) Analysis

**Methodology**: Identified external data groups referenced but not maintained by the application.

| Interface | Complexity Rationale | Weight Assignment |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Database Interface | Average - Standard PostgreSQL interface | 7 FP |
| API Gateway | Average - RESTful API routing | 7 FP |

**Total EIF**: 2 interfaces = 14 Function Pointsß

### 2.6 Complexity Adjustment Factor (CAF) Calculation

The CAF adjusts raw function points based on 14 system characteristics rated 0-5:

**High Impact Factors (Rating 4-5):**
- Data Communications (4): Microservices require inter-service communication via REST API
- Performance (4): Real-time order processing requirements
- Online Data Entry (5): Web-based interfaces for all user roles
- Online Update (5): Real-time order status synchronization
- Facilitate Change (5): Microservices architecture supports modularity

**Calculation**: 
- Total Influence Degree = 53
- CAF = 0.65 + (53 × 0.01) = 1.18
- Raw FP (adjusted for EIF reduction) = 198
- Adjusted FP = 198 × 1.18 = 234 FP (rounded to 240 for estimates)

## 3. COCOMO II ANALYSIS DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 3.1 Size Estimation

**Lines of Code Calculation**:
- Industry average: 53 SLOC per Function Point for web applications
- Estimated SLOC = 240 FP × 53 = 12,720 lines

### 3.2 Scale Factors Analysis

Scale factors adjust the economies/diseconomies of scale:

| Factor | Rating | Value | Justification |

| Precedentedness (PREC) | Nominal | 3.72 | Moderate familiarity with restaurant systems |
| Development Flexibility (FLEX) | High | 2.03 | Agile development approach |
| Architecture/Risk Resolution (RESL) | Nominal | 4.24 | Standard microservices risks identified |
| Team Cohesion (TEAM) | High | 2.19 | Small, co-located development team |
| Process Maturity (PMAT) | Nominal | 4.68 | Standard development processes |

**Total Scale Factor**: 16.86
**Size Exponent (E)**: 0.91 + (0.01 × 16.86) = 1.0786

### 3.3 Effort Multipliers Analysis

Effort multipliers adjust nominal effort based on project characteristics:

**Positive Factors (< 1.0 - Reduce Effort):**
- Analyst Capability (0.85): Experienced business analysts
- Programmer Capability (0.88): Skilled development team
- Language/Tool Experience (0.91): Familiarity with React/Python stack
- Use of Software Tools (0.90): Modern development tools and IDEs

**Negative Factors (> 1.0 - Increase Effort):**
- Database Size (1.14): Significant data storage requirements

**Total Effort Multiplier**: 0.618

### 3.4 Effort and Schedule Calculations

**Nominal Effort Calculation**:
PM = 2.94 × (SLOC/1000)^E × EM
PM = 2.94 × (12.72)^1.0786 × 0.618 = 27.67 Person-Months

**Development Time Calculation**:
TDEV = 3.67 × (PM)^0.28
TDEV = 3.67 × (27.67)^0.28 = 8.59 months

**Team Size Calculation**:
Average Team Size = PM / TDEV = 27.67 / 8.59 ≈ 3.2 developers
